# Sentiment_Detection_App
In this project, I built an AI-driven system that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), TensorFlow, and Keras to classify images based on emotional expressions, specifically detecting whether the expression is Happy or Sad. By analyzing facial features from images, this model provides real-time sentiment analysis.
